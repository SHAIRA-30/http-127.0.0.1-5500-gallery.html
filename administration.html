                        <p><strong>About the President</strong></p>

                        <p>Dr. Mario R. Briones is the third University President of the Laguna State Polytechnic University (LSPU), a premier higher education institution (HEI) in the Province of Laguna, Philippines. He is currently serving as the head of the institution in his second term, having been elected to office in 2019 and re-appointed in 2022 by the LSPU Board of Regents (BOR).</p>
                        
                        <p>As part of his strategic plan for the university, President Briones gears the LSPU towards becoming a center of technology innovation, providing technology-mediated agriculture, fisheries, and other related and emerging disciplines, thus, positioning the university as a prime mover of growth and development of the region and nation.</p>
                        
                        <p>Under the leadership of President Briones, the LSPU stands as a Level 3 State University and College (SUC), the first Institutionally Accredited (IA) SUC in the Calabarzon region, and an ISO-certified agency for its management system (9001:2015), among others.</p>
                        
                        <p>It is also under the term of President Briones that different centers and hubs have been launched and operationalized among the campuses such as the DOST PCAARRD LSPU Agri-Aqua Technology Business Incubator (ATBI) at the Siniloan Campus and Los Baños Campus; the Center for Lakes Sustainable Development (CLSD) at the Los Baños Campus; and the Ideation and Design Development (IDD) and the LSPU Robotics Education Center (REC) at the San Pablo City Campus.</p>
                        
                        <p>Since his assumption to office in 2019, President Briones propelled the enhancement of the curricular programs in compliance with recent memorandum orders issued by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). New curricular programs have been offered such as the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Security Management and Bachelor of Public Administration as a response to the needs of the industry and community. His administration also paved the way for the establishment of LSPU-Liliw Pilot Extension Classes in the Municipality of Liliw in Laguna, extending further the reach and presence of the university.</p>
                        
                        <p>At the height of the pandemic, Dr. Briones led the LSPU at the forefront of providing services to the community both in terms of public service (e.g., providing protective gears, relief operations, information campaign) and educational initiatives (e.g., hosting of Higher Education Bayanihan of the CHEDRO IV-A in training private HEIs in the province to implement flexible learning, and conversion of the university buses into mobile e-learning hubs for students in remote areas with little to no access to the internet). In assuring the uninterrupted quality learning, his administration also pushed for the creation and implementation of the LSPU Learning Continuity Plan (LCP) 2020: Migrating to the New Normal and LCP 2023: Returning to Onsite Learning.</p>
                        
                        <p>His leadership has given birth to many landmark achievements of the LSPU, and the whole of CALABARZON and MIMAROPA has taken notice and has therefore placed their trust and confidence in him as the Regional Chair of the Southern Tagalog Regional Association of State Universities and Colleges (STRASUC) from 2020 to 2022.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr. Briones is an education professional, a holder of the degrees of Master of Arts in Education (MAEd) and Doctor of Education (EdD), both of which specializing in Educational Management. Prior assuming presidency, Dr. Briones served as the Campus Director and Deputy Campus Director of the LSPU-San Pablo City Campus (SPCC), Director of Safety Management Services, Director of Resource Generation and Outsourcing, Director of Extension Services, Dean of the College of Computer Studies, and Chairperson of the Office of Student Affairs and Services. He also participated and completed courses in countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Canada, among others.</p>
                        
                        <p>Acknowledging his contribution in the growth and development of different communities in the region, Dr. Briones has been recognized as an adopted son of Liliw, Sta. Cruz, Los Baños, and Siniloan in Laguna. He was awarded the Presidential Recognition by the previous University Presidents of LSPU, Dr. Ricardo A. Wagan and Dr. Nestor M. De Vera, respectively. In 2013, he was recognized by the ABS-CBN Foundation, Inc., Sagip Kapamilya for his response and trust in times of great need of the Filipino People.</p>
